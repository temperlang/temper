## C++

https://isocpp.org/home/terms-of-use explains how to use the C++ logo.
It explicitly allows using the unaltered logo in tools related to the
C++ language as long as you do not imply endorsement by the ISO C++ organization.

## Java

https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/java-licensing-logo-guidelines-1908204.pdf
explains Oracle branding guidelines and bans using the Java coffee cup
logo without explicit permission.

## JavaScript

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JavaScript_unofficial_logo.svg expains that there's an unofficial JavaScript language logo, and sources it to Chris Williams.

https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/25558/what-is-the-official-javascript-logo-icon echoes that.

Using Chris William's unofficial logo which comports design-wise with the TypeScript logo.

## TypeScript

https://www.typescriptlang.org/branding/ allows use of the TS logo for
talking about TypeScript as long as no endorsement is implied.

> This is the right logo for blog posts, news articles, giveaway stickers and general marketing for yourself.

## Lua

https://www.lua.org/download.html explicitly allows using the Lua logo to give credit.  It's unclear whether
linking is required to use the license, but we'll do it regardless.

> Giving credit
>
> If you use Lua, please give us credit, according to our license. A
> nice way to give us further credit is to include a Lua logo and a
> link to our site [lua.org] in a web page for your product.

## Python

https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/ lists under uses that never
require approval include stating compatibility:

> stating accurately that software is written in the Python
> programming language, that it is compatible with the Python
> programming language ... for non-commercial and commercial uses.

## Rust

https://rustfoundation.org/policy/rust-trademark-policy/ is the controlling policy

Rust disallows using the trademark in any way that implies endorsement
but does allow talking about compatibility/interop, and explaining
that we produce and maintain software in the Rust language:

> Stating accurately that software is written in the Rust programming
> language, that it is compatible with the Rust programming language,
> or that it contains code written in the Rust programming language,
> is allowed. In those cases, you may use the word “Rust” to indicate
> this, without prior approval. This is true both for non-commercial
> and commercial uses.

Also, using Rust trademarks to refer to the Rust project in
publications is explicitly allowed.
