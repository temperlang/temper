# Support for building documentation

Tooling support for extracting snippets of documentation from source
code files and weaving them into documentation files so that they can
be converted to publishable HTML.

This is meant to allow us to provide thorough up-to-date documentation.

Design goals include:
- co-locate as much documentation with the related source code so
  that when making or reviewing code, we often find docs that might
  need to change or be expanded upon,
- allow linking to relevant source code to help people with ideas
  gauge how involved a change would be.
