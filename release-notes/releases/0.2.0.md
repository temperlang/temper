### Started managing release notes

Versions of the Temper tool-chain from now on will have release notes
explaining user-visible changes.  Happy versioning!


<a id="0.2.0--note-0" name="0.2.0--note-0"></a>

### Directory modules

Temper now supports importing full directories as modules rather than individual
files, and this is also now the recommended way for structuring libraries. All
files in a directory module share the same module namespace.

If `config.temper.md` has no imports, it implicitly imports the current
directory as a top-level module for the library:

```temper
    // If this is all you want in config, no need. It's implied by default.
    // Also, note no trailing "/" on imported dirs.
    import(".");
```


<a id="0.2.0--note-2" name="0.2.0--note-2"></a>

### For each loops on lists

JS-style for each loops now work on `List` instances:

```temper
for (let i of [2, 3, 4]) {
  console.log(i.toString());
}
```

This desugars to `.forEach` method calls, with the intention of inlining such
calls at a future point.


<a id="0.2.0--note-3" name="0.2.0--note-3"></a>

### Extract test-only support code

Temper now not only extracts tests from production code; it also extracts
test-only support code.

```temper
test("something") { (test);;
  assertLength(test, "word", 4);
}

let assertLength(test: Test, string: String, expectedLength: Int) {
  // The `assert` macro automatically associates with the `test` parameter.
  assert(string.length == expectedLength);
}
```

Here, `assertLength` is neither exported nor accessed (even transitively) by
exported code, so it also gets extracted from production code according to
backend-specific unit test expectations.
