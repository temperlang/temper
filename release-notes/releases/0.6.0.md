### 🚨Breaking change: Use `=>` for lambda blocks instead of `;;`

To make the syntax possibly more familiar looking, lambda blocks now use thick
arrows to separate the header from the body:

```temper inert
toListBuilderWith { (key: K, value: V): Pair<K, V> =>
  new Pair(key, value)
}
```

Previously, `;;` was used instead of `=>`.

Temper syntax still differs from JS arrow functions in order to accommodate the
trailing block syntax.

Also new, When only parameters are explicit in the lambda block header, parens
are optional, as in this example:

```temper inert
forEach { key, value =>
  builder.add(func(key, value));
}
```

Explicit parameter types also can be given without parens, so long as explicit
*return* type or other components outside the parens are absent:

```temper inert
// The type of parameter *substring* is *String*.
this.substrings.join("") { substring: String => substring }
```

### 🚨Deprecated ` | Bubble` syntax in favour of infix `throws`

Previously, a function definition communicated that it could fail
by including ` | Bubble` at the end of its return type.

Other recent changes, to express nullable types as `T?` instead of
`T | Null` did away with reasons for `|` as a type operator.

Now using `|` as a type operator issues a warning.

```sh
$ temper repl
$ let f(): Int | Bubble { 0 }
1: let f(): Int | Bubble { 0 }
            ┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
[interactive#0:1+9-21]@D: `|` is deprecated for types. Prefer `T?` to `T | Null` and `T throws F` to `T | Bubble`
interactive#0: void
```

The preferred syntax is now to use `throws` instead of `|`:

```sh
$ let g(): Int throws Bubble { 0 }
interactive#1: void
$ g()
interactive#2: 0
```

### 🚨Breaking change: `Int` is now `Int32`, and `Int64` is new

Before, `Int` semantics and sizing depended on each backend. Now, it's an alias
for `Int32`, and it always has wraps on overflow for math ops performed in
Temper-built code. Because of the change in backend semantics, there could be
some change in behavior on some backends.

`Int64` is now also available, and it also wraps on overflow.

Both types map to the most appropriate types available on each backend. No
backend type mapping has changed for the `Int`/`Int32` type, even though math
operations are handled differently now on some backends.

This change enables more consistent semantics in Temper code, and it also looks
toward future optimized CPU-native code support in languages such as Python.

### 🚨Breaking change: Multiline string syntax

Previously, Temper used Python-esque triple quoted string syntax but
with rules for stripping incidental spaces from the beginning and ends
of lines.

```temper intert
let s = """
  Two spaces stripped per line
  Including here
  Can't have """ here
  """;
```

Triple-quoted string syntax has changes so that there is no end
delimiter, and there is a margin-character on each line.

```temper
let s = """
  "<-- That quote mark is not part of this line
  "But it means that we can have """ here without problem
;  // Since this line didn't start with ", the string ended.
```

Spaces (and tabs) are still stripped from the ends of lines, so use
`${}` if you need a line to end with spaces.

This change should make it easier to tell (once you know the rule)
where a line starts, and make it easier to auto-format Temper code
including code with syntax errors.

### Licensing terms changed from EULA to OSS licensing

Previous use of Temper tools was governed by an end user license agreement (EULA).

Old releases are still under the EULA, but this and new releases going
forward are under open-source licensing, as is everything developed at
*https://github.com/temperlang/temper*.

See [the top level *COPYRIGHT* file] for details of the new licensing.

When in doubt, if you have a copy of the command line tools and you
want to know the licensing terms, running `temper license` at the
command line will print the relevant info.
