### Licensing terms changed from EULA to OSS licensing

Previous use of Temper tools was governed by an end user license agreement (EULA).

Old releases are still under the EULA, but this and new releases going
forward are under open-source licensing, as is everything developed at
*https://github.com/temperlang/temper*.

See [the top level *COPYRIGHT* file] for details of the new licensing.

When in doubt, if you have a copy of the command line tools and you
want to know the licensing terms, running `temper license` at the
command line will print the relevant info.
