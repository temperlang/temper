# Temper private &Beta;

Please bear with us while we figure out how to ensure Temper is viable
as a piece of technology infrastructure over the long term and dot our
legal 'i's (and 'Ä±'s).

In the meantime, this is an issues-only repository where you can
report and track problems, request features.
